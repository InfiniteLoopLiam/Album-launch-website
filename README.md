# 💒 Album Launch Website

## Overview

The aim of this website is to promote my upcoming album and springboard interest with aesthetics and functions that feel personal to the listener. The website is currently in development but there is already an emphasis on accessibility and user interaction that has been implemented.

## ✨ Frontend Features

- ♿ Allows the user to disable animations and canvas graphics, which helps users with vestibular disorders. Aria attributes have been implemented for improved screen reader accessibility
- 🎨 Use of canvas element to display unique and haunting graphics that lends itself to the theme of the album
- 🎚️ Use of audio elements for playback functionality (note that audio is not present currently to prevent leaks on the public repo)
- 🔄️ CSS variables controlled and manipulated by JavaScript functions for unpredictable glitchy aesthetics

## Self-reflection

As the development continues with this project, I feel like it allows me to be truly authentic in my craft and create a digital space that I hope resonates with people in a positive way. My attention to detail regarding accessibility is evidence of my duty of care to those who require specific needs and ultimately promotes my music with inclusivity in mind.
